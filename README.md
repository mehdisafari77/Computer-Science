# Computer-Science
A computer science practice for Space/Time complexity

## Summary
A test of runtimes in two different functions with the help of the "execution-time" package of npm. Plus, an algo file with algorthms written alongside their time and space complexity. 

## Testing
1. git clone
2. npm i
3. node runtime.js (for time analysis)
4. node algo.js (for algo testing)
